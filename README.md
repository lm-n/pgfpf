Poetry generated from poetic forms - machine 1

PGFPF is a poetry generator based on The Teachers and Writers Handbook of Poetic Forms. The forms on the Handbook were transformed into functions that with the use of Regular Expression, Natural Language Processing and PoetryDB can generate poems. The project explores the relationship between creative writing and coding, and the proto-programmable nature of handbooks of poetic forms.
